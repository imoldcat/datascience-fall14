Chang'e 5-T1 also carries a private payload called the 4M mission (Manfred Memorial Moon Mission) for the German space technology company, OHB System, in honor of the company's founder, Manfred Fuchs, who died in 2014. Technical management of the 4M mission will be performed by LuxSpace. The payload weighs 14 kilograms and contains two scientific instruments. The first instrument is a radio beacon to test a new approach for locating spacecraft. Radio amateurs will be encouraged via prize incentives to receive the transmissions and send results back to LuxSpace.
